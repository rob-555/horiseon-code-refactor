# horiseon-code-refactor

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Description 

The purpose of this project is to improve web accessability of the website.  Websites are increasingly used by people with disabilities or not up to date browsers, and better acessability enables people to understand websites.  For eaxmple broken links to images now contain an (alt tag) alternative description. This has been done by:

- a descriptve title element 
- comments to signpost each element/section
- CSS to follow semantic sttructure of HTML elements
- heading attributes fall in sequential order  
- consolidaton of CSS selectors/properties 
- image and icon elements now contain accessible `alt` attributes

Certain changes have also been commented as a (personal) reminder of the improvements made. 

I learned that organising code in a coherent and consistent structure, facilitates code review.
